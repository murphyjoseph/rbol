# rbol
### A theme agnostic ui library. About the only thing that Rbol imposes are a few design tokens to ensure consistency across the application. By making limited aesthetic choices and essentially providing a skeleton of each component, you won't get bogged down by aesthetic opinions or overwriting styles at scale. Rbol ui will provide an easy to use component building ui that is robust and flexible.

#### This library is not yet ready for production. Below are somme todos:
1. Fix circular dependency injection
2. Add in unit tests
3. Add in more theming
4. Type out the Theme object
5. Reduce some of the redundancies (e.g. some of the mixins are identical)
6. Work on documentation
7. Configure buttons to take an icon
8. Make design tokens so that they can be extended/overwritten
9. Improve accessibility

#### Components to build:
1. Modal
2. Various fields (checkbox, radio, selectbox)
3. Grid Row and Grid Item
4. Accordion
5. Image
6. Icon
7. Divider
